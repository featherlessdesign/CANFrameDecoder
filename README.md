# CAN Decoder

CAN Decoder 1.0 specifically supports ISO-TP (CAN-TP, ISO 15765-2) frame decoding from OBD data packets. It is not a general purpose CAN-bus decoder (yet!).

CAN Decoder is an ISO 15765-2 CAN frame utility for quickly and easily understanding the contents of CAN bus data frames.

Inspect frame packet data and frame structure in one place on any of your devices.
